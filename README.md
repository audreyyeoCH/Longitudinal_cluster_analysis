Research Aims

1. What are the covariates that influence the evolution of disease state of Pododermatitis ?
2. Perform supervised machine learning using package kml (Genolini et al 2010) to cluster longitudinal data to answer (1).
3. How does scores perform in a robustness checks upon systematic deletion of random individuals ? 

Spoiler Alert :

1. Imputation and missing values
2. Positive selection bias due to replacement of rabbits
3. Few time dependant covariates affect scores marginally (sorry!)

Thanks to the 35+ people who attended on zoom + in person. That's a wrap!
